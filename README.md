## Space Invaders

Recreated the classic 1978 arcade classic using Godot.
<br>
This was a ersonal project to learn GDscript and the Godot game engine.
The project includes a high score tracker, projectile collisions, deteriorating shields, a secret ufo, title screen / game over screen and more!
The game is available to play in the browser through my [itch.io page](https://thomas-flower1.itch.io/space-invaders-clone).

<br>

Some features of the Godot game engine I used were the scene tree, signals, collisions, tilemap, raycasters, scene animations and user input.
