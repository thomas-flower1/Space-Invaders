## Space Invaders

Recreated the classic 1978 arcade classic using Godot
Personal project to learn GDscript and the Godot game engine
The project includes a high score tracker, projectile collisions, deteriorating shield, a secret ufo, title screen / game over screen and more!
The game is available to play in the browser through my [itch.io page](https://thomas-flower1.itch.io/space-invaders-clone).

Creating the game gave me alot of experience with the game engine. Not only was I able to learn GDscript but also learned about collisions, scenes, the scene tree (and how to navigate it) user input, basic raycasting, and game logic.
